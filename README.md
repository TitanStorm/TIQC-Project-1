# TIQC-Project-1
Inventory Management System for TIQC

I want to develop an app that can do the following:
Keep track of donated items (20 + categories)
Assign points value to each item/category
Students are allowed to use their reward points to redeem products. The app should be able to record what items the students have taken and what’s still in inventory. Inventory should be updated as the students redeem products. Student’s reward points should be updated as they redeem the products.
Additional function:
A student should be able to view their reward balances and calculate what items they can redeem with the reward points they have.
